This workflow is an automated **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system that collects articles from the Bitovi blog through a scheduled *scraping* process, then stores the text and metadata of the articles into a Postgres database as *vector embeddings* using OpenAI technology. This system allows an **AI Agent** to accurately answer user questions by searching for relevant information directly from the article database, equipped with conversational memory and the ability to distinguish between meaningful (RAG) or tabular (metadata) searches in order to provide answers along with the original link source.
